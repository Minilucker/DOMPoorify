# DOMPoorify

A ctf-like challenge to demonstrate risks of bad coding practice when developping HTML sanitizers,
it is deliberately vulnerable, so do not use it in another context :)

The bot part of the challenge is powered by [this repo](https://github.com/kevin-mizu/bot-ctf-template)
(like explained in his github, you can exfiltrate using console.log instead of nasty fetch() callbacks)
